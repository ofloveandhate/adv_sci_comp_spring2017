As a user, skip to step 2.  as a developer, to compile this project, you need to

1) Regenerate the configure script, and some other m4 macros, etc, so that the build system is complete.  This requires the autotools, modern versions.  The command for this is

autoreconf -vfi

The -vfi flags are for (v)erbose, (f)orce, and (i)nstall.  If this step fails, you almost certainly have outdated autotools software, most namely automake, autoconf, and libtool.  Update your tools as necessary.

On Linux machines, you may have to run the command

libttoolize

in order to get autoreconf to work.

--------------

As a user, or maintainer, engage in the standard build process for any software built using the autotools.

2) ./configure (with your options)

3) make

Then, if you want to, you can run the test programs.  So far, there is one: nups_test.  It is built using the Boost.UnitTest library, and can produce a variety of output files, and be run in a variety of modes.  These options are not documented here.
